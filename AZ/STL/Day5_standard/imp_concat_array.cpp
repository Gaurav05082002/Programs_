Description

You are given an array A of N integers. Find the length of the largest increasing subsequence if the array A is concatenated to itself N times. A sequence A is a subsequence of an array B if A can be obtained from B by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence should be strictly increasing.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the length of the largest increasing subsequence if the array A is concatenated to itself N times. 


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 2*105

1≤ N ≤ 106

1≤ Ai ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

For the third test case, 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4*/



answer will just number of different elements in array ans nothing else
